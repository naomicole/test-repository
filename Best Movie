I saw a movie called a bugs life. It's about an ant who ruins the mountain of food and the the grasshoppers come and get mad. The bug goes to the big city to find fighters. The fighters just end up being circus freaks who pretend to be fighters. They go back to the ant hill and help the ants build a bird to scare the grasshoppers. The movie ends with lots of rain and the grasshoppers going home.
