I saw a movie called a bugs life. It's about an ant who ruins the mountain of food and the the grasshoppers come and get mad. The bug goes to the big city to find fighters. The fighters just end up being circus freaks who pretend to be fighters. They go back to the ant hill and help the ants build a bird to scare the grasshoppers. A flea comes and lights the bird on fire in an attempt to save evryone but really he just destroys it. The ants start to fight back but then the rain comes. The movie has a happy ending.
I liked this movie because it's really good and I'm convinced that it makes my popcorn taste better.
